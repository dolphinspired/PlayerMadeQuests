# PlayerMadeQuests

Create and share your own custom quests in World of Warcraft: Classic!

Features:

* Write out your own custom quest with just a few lines of YAML script
* **Demo Quests**: short quests provided with the addon to help you learn how to write your own
* **Real-time Objective Tracking**: plays just like a World of Warcraft quest
* **Quest Sharing**: share your quest with party members with the click of a button*
* **Highly Customizable**: any and all quest text to tell the story (or joke) you want to tell
* **Quest Replay**: you can replay any quests that you've finished previously

*Party members must also have PMQ installed in order to receive shared quests

Upcoming plans for PMQ:

* **Quest Chains**: link multiple quests together to form a larger story
* **More Objectives**: involving items, auras, merchants, and more
* **Localization**: share quests reliably between different-language game clients
* **Quest Development Tools**: tools to track coordinates, NPCs, etc. that you want to put in your quests
* **Quest Builder UI**: build your quest with a friendlier user interface instead of writing script

You can play these demo quests directly, or you can save a copy to your Drafts and make some changes, then try it out!

Write your own quests in game with just a few lines of script. If you can write a macro, then you can write a quest for PMQ. You can even share your quests with other PMQ users in your party with just the click of a button!

Quest objectives are tracked and updated in real-time as you complete them. Feels like a real quest, without all the calories!
