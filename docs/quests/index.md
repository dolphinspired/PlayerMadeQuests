# Writing Quests with PMQ

TODO: write overview

## How to write quests

* [Quest recommendations & requirements](requirements.md)
* [Quest start & complete conditions](startcomplete.md)
* [Quest objectives](objectives/index.md)

## More information

* [YAML cheatsheet](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/YAML) - an overview of the YAML syntax used to write quests.
* [lua-tinyyaml](https://github.com/peposso/lua-tinyyaml) - the YAML parser library used in PMQ. Not all features of YAML are supported by this library, so you may want to poke around here if you're trying to use more advanced YAML features and they're not working.
