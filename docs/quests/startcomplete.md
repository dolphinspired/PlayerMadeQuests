# Quest Start & Complete objectives

By default, quests written in PMQ can be started anywhere in the world at any time, simply by selecting the quest from the catalog or by being invited from another player. Similarly, quests can be completed from anywhere by simply opening the quest once all objectives are completed and clicking "Complete Quest".

But quests in WoW generally don't operate this way - you're usually required to talk to an NPC or interact with an object in order to start or complete a quest. To support this flow of gameplay, PMQ provides the **start** and **complete** conditions for quests.

```yaml
start:
  zone: Elwynn Forest
  target: Marshal Dughan
complete:
  zone: Lion's Pride Inn
  target: Innkeeper Farley
```

### What's the difference?

Both properties support all the same parameters and are evaluated in the same way. The only difference is when they're evaluated during a quest.

* **start** - What conditions are required before the player can accept the quest (click the "Accept" button)?
* **complete** - What conditions are required in order for the player to turn in the quest (click the "Complete Quest" button)?
